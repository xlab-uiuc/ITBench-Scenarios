# ITBench-Scenarios

This repository contains infrastructure automation scripts for both deploying the environments and configuring the scenarios required to run [ITBench](https://github.com/IBM/ITBench).
These scenarios are realistic simulations based on actual IT automation challenges faced by CISO, SRE, and FinOps teams.
For example, one of the SRE scenarios is to resolve a “high error rate on service checkout” while a CISO scenario involves assessing the compliance posture for a “new control rule detected for RHEL 9.”
Every ITBench scenario is deployed in a sandboxed operational Kubernetes (K8s) environment.

## [CISO Scenarios](./ciso)
These scenarios simulate compliance-related misconfigurations. Each scenario provides:
- A pre-configured environment with specific compliance issues
- Tools to detect misconfigurations
- Validation methods to verify successful remediation

CISO scenarios are located [here](./ciso).

## [SRE Scenarios](./sre)
These scenarios focus on observability and incident response. Each scenario includes:
- A comprehensive observability stack deployment featuring:
  - Prometheus for metrics collection
  - Clickhouse and OpenSearch for search and analytics
  - Jaeger for distributed tracing
  - OpenTelemetry for Kubernetes event logs collection
- Simulated faults that trigger service degradation
- Thereby leading to alerts associated with application performance issues such as increased error rates and latency spikes

SRE scenarios are located [here](./sre).

## [FinOps Scenarios](./sre)
Each scenario includes:
- The core SRE observability stack
- OpenCost integration for cost monitoring
- Simulated faults trigger cost overrun alerts

FinOps scenarios are located [here](./sre) along-side SRE scenarios.
